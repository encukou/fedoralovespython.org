## fedoralovespython.org

A little webpage that shows why Fedora is a good operating system for
programmers, analysts, teachers, learners, and other people using Python.

It contains some talking points, each with a link to more information.


## How it's deployed

For local development, you have two options:

* Inside a Python 3 [virtual environment]:

        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        python fedoralovespython.py serve

* Alternately, with Fedora's system packages:

        sudo dnf install -y python3-flask python3-markdown python3-PyYAML
        FLASK_APP=fedoralovespython.py python3 -m flask run

The deployment at fedoralovespython.org uses [Elsa] to publish to GitHub Pages.
